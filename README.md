## <center>Reinforcement Learning</center>

`CODE`: [`My RL repo`](https://github.com/biswajitpawl/reinforcement-learning)

#### <mark>What is Reinforcement Learning?

`UAlberta`
* [week 1] Sequential decision making with evaluative feedback
* [week 3] Problem formulation for sequential decision making under uncertainty
* `GOAL`: To maximize future rewards (in expectation) (check Reward Hypothesis)

#### <mark>How is it different from supervised learning?

`UAlberta`
* Agent generates its own data by interacting with the world (environment). [Data is not given to the model]
* Agent learns consequence of its own actions through trial and error (evaluation) rather than being told the correct action. [In SL, we provide data with correct labels/answers]

[`Lex`][1]

* `SL` teaching/learning by example, `RL`: teaching/learning by experience

#### <mark>How is related to (and different from) Control Theory?

`Steve Brunton`
* RL is at the sweet-spot between Control Theory and Machine Learning.
* RL is a branch of ML which essentially deals with how to **learn control strategies** to **interact with a complex environment**. (collects experience)
* *Biologically inspired* idea - Through `trial and error` `+ve/-ve reward signals and feedback`, animals learn how to interact with the environment.
